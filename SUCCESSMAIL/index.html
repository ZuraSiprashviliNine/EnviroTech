                            My name is Li Chang. The first time I got somehow interested in trading was in 1998.
                            At first I was only invested into my mutual fund. After I received some annual profits
                            from this investment, I really became interested in trading. I eagerly opened an
                            online brokerage account with an initial deposit of 2000 $. One day, I saw that a
                            stock called “The Sharper Image” had moved in one day from 8$ to 20$. A few days
                            later it went back down 9$. So, I immediately bought 200 shares. A couple of days
                            after that it shot up to 21$ on the same news. I sold it and doubled my initial 2000$
                            investment.

                                During a few years I had some ups and downs, I earned some money as well as lost
    
                                some money. All that made me learn a lot about trading. I even had a personal train-
                                er. I started trading full-time after a short break in 2006. By going through that learn-
                                ing curve of losing and winning repeatedly, my trades finally became more consis-
                                tent and more profitable. By 2008, the hard work paid off. I turned my 50 000$ trad-
                                ing fund into well over one million dollars in profit by trading market leaders. I can
                                
                                say that right now, trading is an impartial activity of my life. It made me rich and suc-
                                cessful, as well as it taught me to be more concentrated and strong.
