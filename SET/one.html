                                                        Moving to Canada was one of the hardest decisions in my life. I was working at an ordinary school in
                                                        Manila as an English teacher. One day I understood I deserve something more and since Canada has
                                                        been my dream country for a very long time, I decided to give it a try. I only knew I want to go to
                                                        Canada to work and maybe continue studying, and I also realized that getting the visa will cost me a
                                                        lot of money. I was really afraid to deal with companies that claim they would do everything instead
                                                        of me, so, I wasted a lot of time trying to find something suitable. At last I received a call from Solid
                                                        
                                                        Visa representative. She sounded really professional and convinced me to make my first step to-
                                                        wards Canadian dream with their company.

                                                        In the result, in less than 7 months I was holding my passport with a Canadian student visa in my
                                                        hands. I was allowed to study and have a part-time job at the same time. The visa really cost some
                                                        money, but not as much as I expected. When I arrived in Canada 2 months after, even having a
                                                        part-time job, I earned enough money to rent an apartment, buy myself descent food and save
                                                        
                                                        money to send back to my family. Now it’s been a year here. I’ve met a lot of new friends from vari-
                                                        ous countries at University, I proved myself as a hard-worker at the café where I had a part-time job,
                                                        
                                                        so I got promoted. Now I’m working as a manager there and my salary is approximately 7 times
                                                        more than what I had back in Manila. After this short period of time, my so called investment in the
                                                        Canadian dream paid off. Every single dollar invested in this idea was totally worth it. I get the best
                                                        quality of life, one of the best educations in the world. I feel really appreciated and that my opinion
                                                        counts.
