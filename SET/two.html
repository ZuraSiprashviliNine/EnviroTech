                                                        Canada was my only hope 2 years ago when I was living as a refugee in Germany. Most of my family
members died at war. Me and my younger brother were alone in Germany. We had some support
from the government, but obviously it was not enough to have a descent quality of life. Without the
German language it was impossible to find a good job, so, we decided to apply for the Canadian visa
and hope that God would hear our prayers. We found a few companies that were ready to help us,
but only Solid Visa was previously dealing with refugee cases. As we didn’t have any documents
accept refugee cards, this argument was a decision maker for us.

                                                        Getting a Canadian visa turned out to be a long and complicated process. It also cost money: we had
                                                        to borrow some of it from our Syrian relatives. The company kindly allowed us to pay little by little, so
                                                        in a year, after we paid the full sum, both me and my brother got a Canadian work permit as family
                                                        members. We haven’t received any special education back in Syria, so I went working at the farm,
                                                        where the owner trusted me with almost every kind of work. My brother, meanwhile, was hired by
                                                        logistical company as an English-Arabic interpreter (he could speak much better English than me at
                                                        that time). It was so surprising, that in less than 3 month we paid back all of the money we borrowed
                                                        from our relatives. In 5 month I became a chief of this farm I was working at, as the owner opened a
                                                        new one. And my brother started working as a manager in international relations department at
                                                        that logistical company. Now, after a year here we can afford renting an apartment in the center of
                                                        Toronto, we bought a car and we even go to the restaurants from time to time. I could never ever
                                                        
                                                        imagine I would live this kind of life, as in Syria I was desperate and broke. I believe everybody de-
                                                        serves to be appreciated, to earn good money and to enjoy the high quality life.
